## üìÅ Dataset Overview

üëâ **[Download the dataset here](https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/zhaoyp_connect_hku_hk/Em14pK42rO9Lshv2rVNu9vsBaHIsc5CpEzgUY_tbqAfYOA?e=6PBVQG)**

The following folders are included:

- `davis_data/`:  
  The primary dataset used in our paper. Captured with a DAVIS346 event camera during the eSports tournaments.

- `davis_data_b/`:  
  Backup data captured during the eSports tournaments. These samples were not included in the dataset for experiments and final paper due to lower image quality.

- `frame.zip`:  
  Video frames reconstructed from raw event data using [E2VID](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_e2vid).

- `pick/`:  
  Materials and image assets used in the figures of the paper.

## üß† Code Implementation

- **Reconstruction**:  
  We adopt the [E2VID](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_e2vid) model to convert event streams into video frames.

- **Region of Interest Extraction**:  
  Please refer to the pseudocode in our paper for the ROI extraction algorithm.
